# Synopsis
Removes desktop shortcuts generated by the Citrix Self Service Plugin.

# Description
This script was written to work around a bug where the Citrix Self Service Plugin (SSP) creates shortcuts on a user's desktop, and RES
Workspace Manager then saves the SSP shortcuts in their persistent profile. At logoff, RES WM performs its final profile sync, and then Citrix SSP removes the shortcuts from the desktop, resulting in duplicate shortcuts that accumulate with each successive logon.

This script can be invoked at logon to remove the leftover shortcuts before SSP creates additional copies of them.
