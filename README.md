#Remove-CitrixShortcuts.ps1
##Synopsis
Removes desktop shortcuts generated by the Citrix Self Service Plugin.
##Description
This script was written to work around a bug where the Citrix Self Service Plugin (SSP) creates shortcuts on a user's desktop, and RES
Workspace Manager then saves the SSP shortcuts in their persistent profile. At logoff, RES WM performs its final profile sync, and then Citrix SSP removes the shortcuts from the desktop, resulting in duplicate shortcuts that accumulate with each successive logon.

This script can be invoked at logon to remove the leftover shortcuts before SSP creates additional copies of them.
##Examples
###Example:
```PowerShell
Remove-CitrixShortcuts.ps1
```
This would any remove any shortcut files in the user's desktop directory that were generated by the Citrix SSP plugin.
###Example:
```PowerShell
Remove-CitrixShortcuts.ps1 -WhatIf
```
This explains which shortcut files would be deleted, but doesn't actually remove them.
