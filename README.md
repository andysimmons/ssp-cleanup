#Remove-CitrixDesktopShortcuts.ps1
##Synopsis
Removes desktop shortcuts generated by the Citrix Receiver Self Service Plugin.
##Description
This script was written to work around a bug where the Citrix Receiver Self Service Plugin (SSP) creates shortcuts on a user's desktop, and RES Workspace Manager then saves those shortcuts in the user's profile. At logoff, the RES agent performs its final profile sync, and then Receiver removes the shortcuts from the desktop, resulting in duplicate shortcuts that accumulate with each successive logon.

This script can be invoked at logon to remove the leftover shortcuts before the SSP creates additional copies of them (and/or at logoff, to yank them before the final sync).
